# Realistic Test Data

This directory contains a comprehensive data seeding script that populates the Progress Tracker with realistic, diverse test data.

## Running the Seed Script

```bash
node backend/src/seed-realistic-data.js
```

**Note:** This will **clear all existing data** except user accounts. Run with caution!

## What's Included

The seed script creates 7 diverse projects showcasing all application features:

### 7. AI-Powered Support Portal
- **Status:** In progress ‚úÖ
- **Curve:** Linear
- **Frequency:** Weekly
- **Demonstrates:** Agile/sprint tracking, weekly velocity
- **520 story points target - steady progress**

## Features Demonstrated

### Performance Patterns
- ‚úÖ **Overperformance** - Healthcare project exceeding targets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Delinquency** - Banking and e-commerce showing delays
- üîÑ **Recovery** - E-commerce recovering from setbacks
- üìà **Post-completion** - AI platform continuing after success
- üìâ **Diminishing returns** - Supply chain hitting plateau

### Progression Curves
- **Linear** - Steady, predictable progress
- **S-Curve** - Slow start, rapid middle, slow end (adoption curves)
- **Exponential** - Compounding growth (ML training, network effects)
- **Logarithmic** - Quick wins early, harder later (optimization)

### Frequencies
- **Weekly** - Agile sprint tracking
- **Monthly** - Most common, general project tracking
- **Quarterly** - Executive reporting, large initiatives

### Additional Features

- **Time Travel** - Audit logs showing historical changes
- **Realistic Commentary** - Authentic project narratives

## Time Travel Capabilities

The seed data includes historical audit logs demonstrating:
- Metric value revisions with explanations
- Project description updates
- CRAID status changes (open ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí resolved)
- Commentary on delays and recovery plans

## Use Cases

This data set is perfect for:
- **Demos** - Show prospective clients realistic project tracking
- **Training** - Onboard new users with realistic scenarios
- **Testing** - Validate features with diverse data patterns
- **Development** - Test edge cases and performance
- **Presentations** - Screenshot-ready professional examples

## Data Highlights
