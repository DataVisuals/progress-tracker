## Next Steps

To run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

To run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Database Strategy

Tests should use a separate test database to avoid interfering with development data:
- Create `data/test-progress-tracker.db` for testing
- Clean up after each test suite
- Use transactions where possible for faster cleanup
